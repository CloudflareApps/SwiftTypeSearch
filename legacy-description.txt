# Swiftype Search

Add modern search to your site with one click! No code changes are required on your site.

The Swiftype Search App will add a “Search This Site” tab to the bottom of your website.

When clicked, the tab becomes a search overlay that will let your users find what they’re looking for with fast full-text search and autocomplete. No design changes are necessary to get great search.

With Swiftype, you gain complete control over how your results are ordered and insight into what your visitors are searching for -- and the results they’re finding.

<strong>Note:</strong> Search results will be available a few minutes after adding the app (we need to crawl your website before displaying results).

# Features

## See what your users are searching for with detailed analytics

## Drag-and-drop to search result re-ordering

Swiftype constantly works to improve our search relevance. But ultimately, you should be in control of your search results. With Swiftype, you can perform a search, then drag and drop the results to your liking. You can also remove results, or add additional results.
